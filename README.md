# OXPathValidator_GWT

A sample GWT project with a validator for OXPath expressions.

Input an expression into the text field and hit 'send'. The expression is parsed by the OXPathParser and the application tells you whether the expression is syntactically valid. If not, the error message from the parser is presented.
